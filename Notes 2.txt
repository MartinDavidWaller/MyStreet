Jerry Walker I think it is looking towards the church. The little black building on the left is the Old Blacksmith's (replaced be the Council Bungalow on the corner of St. Andrews Road). Alma Cottage (our house) is immediately on the left, and on the right is the end of the terraced cottages, with Lil McCoy's just peeking out beyond. The White House at the bottom is the Old Farmhouse (Spalding's Farm????)
